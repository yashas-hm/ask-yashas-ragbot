    "philosophy": {
      "frontend": "I build applications that feel as good as they look. Using Flutter and Dart, I combine architectural discipline with a focus on micro-interactions and accessibility, ensuring that complex functionality never compromises the user experience.",
      "backend": "My backend philosophy is simple: use the best tool for the job. I architect high-concurrency services using Node.js, while leveraging Python and FastAPI to power complex AI pipelines. I build systems that are not just fast, but intelligent.",
      "infrastructure": "Great software needs a solid foundation. From vector search in ChromaDB to relational structures in PostgreSQL, I design data ecosystems that scale. I use Docker and GitHub Actions to ensure that deployment is boring, predictable, and fast.",
      "leadership": "Engineering is an art form. My background in music and stage performance shapes how I build software with structure, rhythm, and the audience in mind. It fuels my ability to perform under pressure and communicate complex technical ideas with clarity and confidence."
